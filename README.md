# dotfiles

To install the dotfiles in your `$HOME` directory, run

```sh
curl -# -L "https://tinyurl.com/bens-dotfiles" 2> '/dev/null' | bash
```

The tiny URL is for this [install script gist](https://gist.github.com/benelan/c05cd2892a7ca684fb0a850e851151ef), which you can save and run locally as an alternative.


The bare repo idea for managing dotfiles is from a [Hacker News thread](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=11071754).
